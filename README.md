# GoodCatBadCat

This was my first project with React Native. I can't say I am too proud of this project. I learned a lot getting to play around with React Native for a few hours. Maybe I learned more of what not to do. Still, I wanted to upload this, so I can look back in the future to see how far I have come. 

## Lessons Learned
  - Through the gif I am clicking the buttons, but I didn't add animations to the buttons to see the screen clicks. In the future I would use Paper or Material UI styling libraries to improve the UX
  - I use a cat and dog api to generate images which I just saved in array of strings (In the future I would want to store this state using redux, or flux).
  - I used the default bottom Navigation, but would want to customize this to look a little better.

# GoodCatBadCat

This was my first project with React Native. I can't say I am too proud of this project. I learned a lot getting to play around with React Native for a few hours. Maybe I learned more of what not to do. Still, I wanted to upload this, so I can look back in the future to see how far I have come. 

## Lessons Learned
Through the gif I am clicking the buttons, but I didn't add animations to the buttons to see the screen clicks.
